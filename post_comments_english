11,"Yeah, Tesla is really great. For example you pay 15K USD for FSD and get at the moment therefore, exactly, nothing. And you only get a promise for the future. But it is absolutely unsure if autonomous driving will ever happen. So at Tesla, you pay 15K USD for absolutely nothing and do not know if someday the FSD will come. In Germany, the system can not even read roadsigns, my 29K EUR MG4 can 😂😂😂😂. So, never ever a Musik-Mobile!!!!",en

When the panel was removed we assume somehow a kitten got in and the service team then trapped it when they put back the panel. My husband kept hearing something meow after picking it up from servicing. He stopped multiple times to see where it was coming from. Finally late at night we heard the meowing again from the living room with the car parked in the garage. We went back and looked at the car and there it was struck in the frunk compartment. We tried calling all Tesla numbers but no pick up. We tried road side service and they weren't surprised one bit! They simply advised us to go back to to the service team tomorrow.

We stayed up all night to make sure the kitten did not die and drove immediately to the service team. As they removed all components that kitten jumped out right into another Tesla. The guys said this is the second time this has happened as there's a cat family in the creek nearby! What in the world!

578,"You are now in two categories, Snak or Eagle Snakes produce cars and try to destroy mankind and the planet , and the second group are gods, whose symbol is an eagle, the eagles produce flying cars and try to preserve humanity and nature.
Maybe you don't know that religion, and drugs of morphin and cars were the three main factors of human destruction. The first symbol of human was the eagle. If the snakes minded did not win, today Mars would be more modern than New York. and And many cities were built in space and hundreds of flying cities in the form of spaceships with human citizens were living in the solar system and the Milky Way.
The human brain, thought, and culture, belief, economic and religious structure has moved so deeply towards snake-like feelings that it considers the life mentioned above as a fantasy.

In fact, life in space could have occurred five thousand years before Christ, and modern technology and space technologies could have been invented ten thousand years before the religion of Christ.
Man moved towards the life of a snake when he discovered drugs, but gradually man is developing, but the world is still ruled by snakes, but freedom and final development are near.
the cars are kind of snake life but you don't understand today because the culture and genetics of snakes have been imposed on you for more than a thousand years.
The snakes will be defeated and all their automobile factories and their governments, their lives and their mafia and terrorist gangs and their fearful and toxic lives and culture will be destroyed.

Illuminati has decided to turn the dictatorial country, China, into the world superpower instead of the USA. Also Illuminati is giving countries one by one to Russia, because through Russia, illuminati brings disasters to the people of countries that they could not do before and the fact that Muslim governments and terrorist organizations are being produced and managed by a communist country is something that no one notices and their plans are not disclosed.
They have also decided to convert Canada, Europe and the USA to Islamic countries in order to change to undeveloped and lagged colonial countries and to do so, they produced government of the Islamic Republic of Iran by Russia and the illuminati gave the Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps all the big companies and factories and sources of income in Iran for spending on Islamic propaganda in Europe and America and creation of terrorist groups.
Lots of mosques are made every year in Europe and the United States by agents of the IRGC and billions are spent for propagating Islam, attracting illiterate and unwise people, provoking and turning them into opponents of their government under the pretext of fighting capitalism and injustice and establishing Islamic justice.
Gradually, traitors and criminals, with a religious appearance, will come to power. Literate and skilled managers will be killed so that the developed countries will change to lagged colonies managed by Russia.
Whenever the people of a country rise up against their dictatorial government, they face US sanctions because sanctions cut people off from the world and paralyze the people, and the people will not be able to overthrow the dictatorial government.",en
